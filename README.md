- To add to the challenge, i decided to code this using Vanilla Javascript. Difficult, but very satisfying when it works
- First time using localStorage for variables! Very exciting
- Figured out the getElementsByClassName used HTMLCollection which updates live, took a while to realise that changing pages causes this function to empty its array and add in new ones, but the DOM fired immediately as the code did and resulted in a blank array. I realised this function took longer to process and made it async, and it all turned out fine :)
